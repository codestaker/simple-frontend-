This project is a simple frontend web page built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates basic client-side interaction, input handling, and simple validation logic. The page collects a user’s name and displays a greeting message based on the input provided.

The project also serves as a basic example of frontend testing concepts such as user error handling and test case validation.

JavaScript checks the input value.

If the input is empty, an error message is displayed.

If the input is valid, a greeting message is shown.

Frontend Testing Overview
Possible User Errors

Submitting the form without entering a name.

Entering invalid input such as blank spaces.

Test Cases

Empty Input Test:
User clicks submit with no input.
Expected result is an error message prompting the user to enter a name.

Valid Input Test:
User enters a valid name and clicks submit.
Expected result is a greeting message displaying the entered name.

Impact of Testing

Frontend testing helped ensure correct handling of user input and prevented invalid submissions. It improved usability by guiding users with clear feedback and improved correctness by avoiding unintended behavior.
