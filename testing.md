# Frontend Testing

This project demonstrates basic frontend testing for a simple web page, focusing on handling user inputs and ensuring proper functionality.

## Possible User Errors

- Clicking the submit button without entering any name.
- Entering invalid input such as blank spaces.

## Test Cases

### 1. Empty Input Test
- **Scenario:** The input field is left empty and the submit button is clicked.  
- **Expected Outcome:** The system displays an error message requesting the user to enter a name.

### 2. Valid Input Test
- **Scenario:** A valid name is entered and the submit button is clicked.  
- **Expected Outcome:** The system displays a greeting message containing the user’s name.

## Role of Testing

Frontend testing verified that the web page responds correctly to both valid and invalid user inputs. It ensured proper input validation, prevented incorrect or misleading output, and improved the overall usability and reliability of the application.
